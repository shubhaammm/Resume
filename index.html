    <h1>BLOCKCHAIN</h1>

    <p>A blockchain is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records,
         called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains
          a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
           as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the
            transaction data existed when the block was created. Since each block contains information about
             the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), 
             with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions
              are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered 
              retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.A blockchain is a type of Digital Ledger

                   <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. <sup>[5]</sup></p>
